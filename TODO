## todo ##
* better UI for the votes...songs should float into position when they are voted upon, to avoid people having trouble when trying to click on a song as it is being voted on
* we should have receivers for all actions, not just votes (i.e., song started/stopped, user joined/left)
* scope actions to a particular bar
* bar client needs to upload status, not just download it

## done ##
* add users so that we can track user actions and limit per user actions/votes
* voting should be ajaxy instead of reloading the page
